## Introduction 

Koffiechefs is a platform where coffee roasters can offer their bespoke roasted coffees. These coffees can be bought by normal consumers. The concept is similar to a webshop where the products can be supplied by everyone that registers on the platform. A bit like Bol.com or Amazon but specifically for coffee.

## Inspiration

The selection of the bean amount and type of grind is inspired by the selection of coolblue.nl, see image down below for their implementation.

This implementation shows an overview of all the options without having to click a dropdown first as example. The website of koffiebazen (koffiebazen.nl) has this as implementation:

## Product Vision

We have received a document citing all the requirements for this project, categorized in user type. These requirements use the MOSCOW method with each requirement identified with a Must have, should have or could have. 
Our project is defined by these requirements and so is our product vision.

This app is for Roasters of coffee and enthusiastic drinkers of coffee, who want to sell or buy freshly homemade coffee beans. The Koffiechefs app is currently an android app that allows a home roaster to sell his coffee beans easily and securely with direct payments to the roaster. Unlike buying from other online stores, our product guarantees that all coffee beans on the app will be homemade and not from some factory.

Here are a few mockups of Koffiechefs:
